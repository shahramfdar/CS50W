These are the lecture notes for CS50 course.
Git:
git clone: will clone the repository to the local computer.
git add:  will include files to the next repository on the next commit.
git commit: Will save the file to your local copy of repository.
  example:  Git Commit -m "i have made additions to notes"
git status: will keep track of your repository activity and a comparison with Github version.
git push: will send the local repository changes to Github repository.
git pull: will copy the github repository delta to your local repository. This is helpful when someone else has made changes to the github repository making it easier to collaborate.
Merge errors can result when multiple people make additions to the same line of code. When doing a git pull you will see merge errors, to correct these simply clear out the conflicts and commit locally before doing a push.
git log: will provide the details of all commits in the github repository.
git reset --hard "first four of index": resets the changes made to local repo after the targeted commit
git reset -- hard origin/master: resets the changes to the original copy repository.
git clean
git reflog -- Keeps the complete log
git reset --hard head~2: sets the head back 2 commits
git checkout -- filename: this will remove uncommitted changes from your file.
git checkout -- .: this will remove uncommitted changes from your local repository.
git branch : show a list of all the branches in your repository.
git branch newname: creates a branch in repository
git checkout branchname: switches the current branch.
git merge branchname: will merge the branch with current branch.
git push --setupstream origin newbranchname: this will set new branch in github.
git push --delete origin  newbranchname: this deletes branches on github.
git branch -D newbranchname: this deletes branches locally.
