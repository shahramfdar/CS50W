These are the lecture notes for CS50 course.
Git:
git clone: will clone the repository to the local computer.
git add:  will include files to the next repository on the next commit.
git commit: Will save the file to your local copy of repository.
  example:  Git Commit -m "i have made additions to notes"
git status: will keep track of your repository activity and a comparison with Github version.
git push: will send the local repository changes to Github repository.
git pull: will copy the github repository delta to your local repository. This is helpful when someone else has made changes to the github repository making it easier to collaborate.
Merge errors can result when multiple people make additions to the same line of code. When doing a git pull you will see merge errors, to correct these simply clear out the conflicts and commit locally before doing a push.
git log: will provide the details of all commits in the github repository.
git reset --hard:
git reset -- hard origin/master:
This is a test
